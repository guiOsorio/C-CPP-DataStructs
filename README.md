# C-CPP-DataStructs
This repository holds the implementation of certain data structures and operations useful to them in C and C++.

## Data structures covered:
- Queue
   - implementation of a queue using an array;
   - implementation of a queue using a linked-list;
- Stack
   - implementation of a stack using an array;
   - implementation of a stack using a linked-list;
   - checking if an operation is balanced is terms of (), {} and []
- Binary Tree
   - creating a binary tree;
   - deleting an element;
   - finding an element's successor;
   - printing the tree in different orders:
     - level order;
     - pre order;
     - in order;
     - post order
   - checking if a tree is a binary search tree;
   - searching a node;
   - inserting a node;
   - finding min and max values;
   - finding the height of a tree.
